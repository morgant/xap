INSTALL
-------

Extract the source code archive in a directory where you want, e.g.
in your HOME directory with the following command:

    tar -xzvf xap-<version>.tar.gz

This will create a subdirectory "xap". Change into this directory.

Start the "setup.tcl" program and execute the following
steps (this needs tcl/tk 8.0 or newer):

	1. Make Makefile
	2. Compile
	3. Install

OR in the classic way:

	1. run the "configure" program
	2. say "make"
	3. and then "make install"

If you have done these steps, try to start "xap" or "xwf"

Don't forget to install the mini-icons of xap and xwf if your window-manager
likes it.. and may be if you are using MLVWM you can use the sample Mlvwmrc-xwf
file..

NOTE: don't forget, you need glib/gtk+ 1.2.0 or newer!
